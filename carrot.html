## Projects

__[Almeda](https://www.facebook.com/AlmedaDC/)__ is a band that I play bass in with Adaeze Eze (Vocals), Danny O'Brien (Guitar/Keys) and Dan Sheehan (Drums). We are working on producing our first full-length album. It will be out in fall 2016.

__Comedy__.  
From time to time I work on comedy bits that I perform at open mics around DC and elsewhere. I was the president of my high school stand-up comedy club for two years and I try to still keep it up. Here's a taste:


> _In the old days, criminals would sometimes be stoned to death. Rocks are one thing, but imagine being hit with turtles instead, I mean they look a lot like rocks, but theyâ€™re turtles. It hurts, then you feel bad for those poor turtles._

Beginning work on an Android application that will ping every time its user passes over the LHC and surrounding accelerators, mapping out their locations underground over time.

More apps and ideas to come!

I like to think about the future, and dream that I could have a hand in creating it. Me, seizing the possibilities to create the futuristic future. There's so much to be excited about, to worry about, and to dream about. It's going to be wonderful kind of day.
