## Projects

__[Almeda](https://www.facebook.com/AlmedaDC/)__ is a band that I play bass in with Adaeze Eze (Vocals), Danny O'Brien (Guitar/Keys) and Dan Sheehan (Drums). We are working on producing our first full-length album. It will be out in fall 2016.

__Comedy__.  
From time to time I work on comedy bits that I perform at open mics around DC and elsewhere. I was the president of my high school stand-up comedy club for two years and I try to still keep it up. Here's a taste:


> _In the old days, criminals would sometimes be stoned to death. Rocks are one thing, but imagine being hit with turtles instead, I mean they look a lot like rocks, but theyâ€™re turtles. It hurts, then you feel bad for those poor turtles._

__Wolf Counter App__.  
I am currently working on an Android app that will tell its users just how many wolves there are in their state at that exact time.

__Large Hadron Collider Buzz Ring App__.  
I am also working on another great app idea which aims to make a trip to the Large Hadron Collider just a bit more fun!

From my experience, people know that the LHC is definitely "down there," but just how many people can say that they know where? My app will once and for good try to clear up this mystery that is as old as the Large Hadron Collider itself. I will program in precise coordinates that I covertly gained access to through the supercomputer databanks at CERN while I was an intern there. Every time a user passes over the LHC on the surface his/her phone will buzz and bleep and record the crossing point, gradually filling in portions of the ring superimposed on a map of the area. Now, few people know this, but there is actually more than one accelerator ring at CERN! The coordinates of the Proton Synchrotron, Linac2, the PSB, Linac3, LEIR, LEAR, the SUPER Proton Synchrotron, ISOLDE, AD, and even the Compact Linear Collider facility will all be mapped and have different discovery effects. When one uncovers them all the stargate will finally be opened! What an attraction!

Sally the wind turbine!

I like to think about the future, and dream that I could have a hand in creating it. Me, seizing the possibilities to create the futuristic future. There's so much to be excited about, to worry about, and to dream about. It's going to be wonderful kind of day.
