## Projects

<small>
__[Almeda](https://www.facebook.com/AlmedaDC/)__ is a band that I play bass in with Adaeze Eze (Vocals), Danny O'Brien (Guitar/Keys) and Dan Sheehan (Drums). We have just released our first EP, independently recorded and produced. Check it out on __[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-866033330)__.
We will be releasing more songs throughout the year, and a full-length album in the spring.

__Comedy__.  
From time to time I work on comedy bits that I perform at open mics around DC and elsewhere. I was the president of my high school stand-up comedy club for two years and am a part of the Georgetown Stand-Up Secret Society. Here's a silly one:

Beginning work on an Android application that will ping every time its user passes over the LHC and surrounding accelerators, mapping out their locations underground over time.

I am working on a senior honors thesis in graphene P-I-N junction terahertz detectors. The terahertz frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum (sub-mm to mm wavelengths) has tremendous potential for applications in security, spectroscopy, astronomy, medicine, and more. Yet, this range can only studied with expensive machines that operate at cryogenic temperatures. Graphene has shown great experimental and theoretical promise for sustaining optoelectronic devices that operate in the THz range. Furthermore, graphene is wholly integrable with silicon electronics, cheap to produce (compared to the existing types of THz electronics), and has the potential to support the development of devices that operate at room-temperature. My senior thesis is to develop a type of graphene THz detector that can operate at high temperatures with a high responsivity, primarily by exploiting the hot-electron photo-thermoelectric effect and plasmonic resonance effect in graphene.

I have also written a proposal for the __[National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)__ that focuses on a similar optoelectronic phenomenon in graphene: terahertz lasing.

__Various Extraneous Activities__.

Linux: I run Linux Mint on my laptop and am actively learning more about Linux development.

French: Although I took Spanish in high school, and placed out of the Georgetown language requirement with it, I have recently really gotten into French. I starting learning on my own in January of last year when I found out I would be going to CERN. I worked hard and took French lessons while I was living abroad. I took a Georgetown placement test upon returning to the States and placed out of four semesters of classes! I took a class last spring and hope to continue learning more as I get older.

I like to think about the future and dream that I could have a hand in creating it. There's so much to be excited about. I hope to one day look back on what I have done with my life and see that the world is somehow in a better place because of it. That's the dream that drives me forward to a career as a scientist.
