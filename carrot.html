## Projects

__[Almeda](https://www.facebook.com/AlmedaDC/)__ is a band that I play bass in with Adaeze Eze (Vocals), Danny O'Brien (Guitar/Keys) and Dan Sheehan (Drums). We have just released our first EP, independently recorded and produced. Listen/download it for free here, on __[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-866033330)__.
We will be releasing more songs throughout the year, and a full-length album in the spring.

__Comedy__.  
From time to time I work on comedy bits that I perform at open mics around DC and elsewhere. I was the president of my high school stand-up comedy club for two years and am a part of the Georgetown Stand-Up Secret Society. Here's a silly one:

I am working on a senior honors thesis in graphene P-I-N junction terahertz detectors. The terahertz frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum (sub-mm to mm wavelengths) has tremendous potential for applications in security, spectroscopy, astronomy, medicine, and more. Yet, this range can only studied with expensive machines that operate at cryogenic temperatures. Graphene has no bandgap which gives it a broadband optical response. Graphene has shown great experimental and theoretical promise for sustaining optoelectronic devices that operate in the THz range. Furthermore, graphene is wholly integrable with silicon electronics, cheap to produce (compared to the existing types of THz electronics), and has the potential to support the development of devices that operate at room-temperature. My senior thesis is to develop a type of graphene THz detector that could operate at high temperatures, and with a high responsivity, primarily by exploiting the hot-electron photo-thermoelectric effect and plasmonic resonance effect in graphene.

For my research, I construct custom device architectures using a variety of nano-fabrication techniques including photo and e-beam lithography, reactive ion etching, metallic sputtering, and atomic layer deposition, in Georgetown's Microscience and Nanotechnology Lab (GNU Lab). I then test the devices with sources of THz radiation, and at a variety of temperatures using a cryostat. 

I have also written a proposal for the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship that focuses on a similar optoelectronic phenomenon in graphene: terahertz lasing. 

Recent work has shown that population inversion can be sustained in graphene. In my proposal I discuss plans to build somewhat similar graphene-based P-I-N junction devices like what I use to make THz detectors, to electrically pump graphene micribbons and incite population inverison and spontaneous emission of photons of THz light. I would start with proof-of-concept devices and eventually build them into robust graphene lasers. This would potentially open up a whole new area of development for graphene-based THz optoelectronics.

More apps and ideas to come!

I like to think about the future, and dream that I could have a hand in creating it. Me, seizing the possibilities to create the futuristic future. There's so much to be excited about, to worry about, and to dream about. It's going to be wonderful kind of day.
