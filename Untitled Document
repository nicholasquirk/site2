__Wolf Counter App__.  
I am currently working on an Android app that will tell its users just how many wolves there are in their state at that exact time.

From my experience, people know that the LHC is definitely "down there," but just how many people can say that they know where? My app will once and for good try to clear up this mystery that is as old as the Large Hadron Collider itself. I will program in precise coordinates that I covertly gained access to through the supercomputer databanks at CERN while I was an intern there. Every time a user passes over the LHC on the surface his/her phone will buzz and bleep and record the crossing point, gradually filling in portions of the ring superimposed on a map of the area. Now, few people know this, but there is actually more than one accelerator ring at CERN! The coordinates of the Proton Synchrotron, Linac2, the PSB, Linac3, LEIR, LEAR, the SUPER Proton Synchrotron, ISOLDE, AD, and even the Compact Linear Collider facility will all be mapped and have different discovery effects. When one uncovers them all the stargate will finally be opened! What an attraction!
