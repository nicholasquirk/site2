## About

I am a senior at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. where I major in physics and do research in graphene-based microelectronic devices. I chose physics because I dream of the brilliant technological future; the fantastic world of limitless clean energy, interplanetary travel, and artificial intelligence that pops up in so many Hollywood science fiction blockbusters. I want to spend my life working on the edge of knowledge creating new technologies based on new concepts in physics that will have broad impacts on the world and work to make this dream of the technological future a reality.

This is an exciting time to be alive, especially as a young scientist. My generation has a greater opportunity to make real technological achievements than any before. I have already been a part of some of the amazing forefronts of science with internships at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Caltech in Pasadena, CA, and at Georgetown where I work in the lab of Professor Paola Barbara. I am applying to Ph.D. programs in experimental physics for the fall of 2017, with a concencentration in condensed matter. The road to the Ph.D. will give me the depth of knowledge and experience needed to conduct quality research that can lead to discoveries that will contribute to people's everyday lives as well as set the stage for future technology advancements by others.
 
I went to high school in Plaistow, New Hampshire, where I graduated as valedictorian of the class of 2013. Beside academics, I am passionate about playing the orchestral double bass. I have been the principal bassist of the Georgetown Symphony Orhestra for three years. I also play the bass guitar in a Rock/RnB group called Almeda with friends at Georgetown. What do I want to do with my life?---

---Spend my life doing something I enjoy so much that I need to be grounded back to reality.
