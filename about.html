## About

I am a rising senior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. There, I major in physics but also enjoy peering into other disciplines with brief bouts in theology, philosophy, music, and literature courses. I went to high school in Plaistow, New Hampshire, where I graduated as Valedictorian of the class of 2013. Besides academics, I am passionate about playing the double bass in symphonic and jazz settings. I also play the bass guitar in a Rock/RnB group called Almeda with friends at Georgetown. What do I want to do with my life? 
“In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage." From The Joy of Painting. Find something that moves me like painting moved Bob Ross.
