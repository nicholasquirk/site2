## About
<small>
I am a senior at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. where I major in physics and do research in graphene-based microelectronic devices. I chose physics because I dream of the brilliant technological future: the fantastic world of limitless clean energy, interplanetary travel, and artificial intelligence that pops up in so many Hollywood science fiction blockbusters. I want to spend my life working on the edge of knowledge trying to make this dream of the technological future a reality.

I am applying to Ph.D. programs in experimental physics for enrollment in the fall of 2017, with a concencentration in condensed matter. Beside academics, I am passionate about playing the double bass. I have been the principal bassist of the Georgetown Symphony Orchestra for three years. I also play the bass guitar in a Rock/RnB group called Almeda with friends at Georgetown. What do I want to do with my life?---

---Spend my life doing something I enjoy so much that I need to be grounded back to reality.
