## About

I am a senior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. I major in physics but also enjoy peering into other disciplines having tried brief bouts into the uncharted with theology, philosophy, music, and literature courses. I do research in graphene nanoelectronics and optoelectronics in the lab of Dr. Paola Barbara. I enjoy studying physics and the reward of tackling challenging problems. I went to high school in Plaistow, New Hampshire, where I graduated as valedictorian of the class of 2013. In the fall I plan to apply to graduate school to pursue doctoral studies in physics. Beside academics, I am passionate about playing the double bass in symphonic and jazz settings. I also play the bass guitar in a Rock/RnB group called Almeda with friends at Georgetown. What do I want to do with my life?---

---Spend my life doing something I enjoy so much that it makes the normalities of life seem peculiar.
