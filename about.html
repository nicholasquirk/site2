## About

I am a senior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC where I major in physics and do research in graphene nanoelectronics and optoelectronics in the lab of Dr. Paola Barbara. I enjoy peering into other disciplines and have tried brief bouts into the uncharted with theology, philosophy, music, and literature courses. I've chosen to move ahead with my life in physics and apply to graduate school to pursue doctoral studies in experimental condensed matter physics.
 
I went to high school in Plaistow, New Hampshire, where I graduated as valedictorian of the class of 2013. Beside academics, I am passionate about playing the double bass in symphonic and jazz settings. I also play the bass guitar in a Rock/RnB group called Almeda with friends at Georgetown. What do I want to do with my life?---

---Spend my life doing something I enjoy so much that I need to be grounded back to reality.
